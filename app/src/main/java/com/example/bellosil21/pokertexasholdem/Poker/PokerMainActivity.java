/**
 * Upon our final release, our game has met all necessary requirements for
 * this assignment. Currently, our game supports all the rules of play that
 * we agreed to implement which includes the actions, and hand ranking
 * procedure. Likewise, the user interface functionality is working
 * masterfully in that all the functionality of all buttons has been
 * implemented and the GUI updates accordingly for each player respectively.
 * The "smart" and "dumb" computer AI has been carefully crafted in order to
 * visually and practically notice the change in play style and outcome.
 * Moreover, our game supports network play across Android tablets of the same model.
 * Additionally, our game is also able to run with two, three, and four
 * players locally and remotely. We have added small details to the GUI for
 * style and neatness, and general user friendly environment that includes a
 * text showing the round standings and a text showing the big and small
 * blinds. Not to mention, we were also able to display the "info", "help",
 * "settings", and "exit" buttons.
 *
 * The "info" button toggles whether the end of round standings is shown.
 *
 * The "help" button shows how to play the game.
 *
 * The "settings" button has an option to display the game in English or in
 * Spanish.
 *
 * The "exit" button gives the user a choice of whether to exit the game or
 * stay in the game.
 *
 * We have also added a new button that displays the various types of hand
 * ranks for the user's reference in learning which hands are better than
 * others. For reference, this button is located in the most left side of the
 * GUI above the "Texas Hold'em" logo. As of the final release, this addition
 * is functional.
 *
 * For the final release, we have added sounds to our game. Different sounds
 * are played when it is the player's turn, at the start of a new round, when
 * a player is out of funds, when a player checks legally, when a player
 * shows their cards, when a player raises a bet legally, and when the blinds
 * are raised.
 *
 * We are currently still having issues with one bug. On game
 * start,  there is a chance that the GUI and game will not load properly.
 * This is less likely to happen when the user waits longer in the config
 * screen before starting.
 *
 * In the beta release, we said we were going to implement a smarter AI;
 * however, we ran into problems with its implementation. It used the
 * HankRanker on every action to determine the best hand they had at every
 * phase. However, this led the game to crashing or being stalled our on the
 * smarter AI's turn. Because the HandRanker is used in the core of our
 * game's functionality of distributing pots, we did not wish to alter its
 * implementation within the close proximity of assignment's deadline.
 * Therefore, we choose to disregard implementing our smarter AI in order to
 * preserve the stability of our game.

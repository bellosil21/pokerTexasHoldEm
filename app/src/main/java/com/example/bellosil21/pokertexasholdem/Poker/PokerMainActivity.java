/**
 * Upon beta release, our game has met all necessary requirements for this assignment. Currently,
 * our game supports all the rules of play that we agreed to implement which includes the
 * actions, and hand ranking procedure. Likewise, the user interface functionality is working
 * masterfully in that all the functionality of all buttons has been implemented and the GUI
 * updates accordingly for each player respectively. The "smart" and "dumb" computer AI has been
 * carefully crafted in order to visually and practically notice the change in play style.
 * Moreover, our game now supports network play across Android tablets of the same model.
 * Additionally, our game is also able to run with two, three, and four players locally and
 * remotely. We have added small details to the GUI for style and neatness, and general user
 * friendly environment that includes a text showing the round standings and a text showing the
 * big and small blinds. Not to mention, we were also able to display the "help", "settings", and
 * "exit" buttons.
 *
 * The "exit" button gives the user a choice of whether to exit the game or stay in the game. The
 * "settings" button currently only supports the user's choice whether to play in Spanish or
 * English and the given state of the game will remain the same. The "help" button however, has
 * not yet been implemented.
 *
 * We have also added a new button that displays the various types of hand ranks for the user's
 * reference in learning which hands are better than others. As of the beta release, this
 * addition is functional.
 *
 * We are currently still having issues with the following bugs.
 * When it is a given player's turn, the toast will display indicating that player that it is
 * there turn. However, there is a bug that displays the toast twice.
 * The spanish implementation is not finished yet as in the actions are translated yet when
 * playing the game.

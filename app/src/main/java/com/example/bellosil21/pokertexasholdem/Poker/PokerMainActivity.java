/**
 * Upon beta release, our game has met all necessary requirements for this assignment. Currently,
 * our game supports all the rules of play that we agreed to implement which includes the
 * actions, and hand ranking procedure. Likewise, the user interface's functionality is working
 * masterfully in that all the functionality of all buttons has been implemented and the GUI
 * updates accordingly for each player respectively. The "smart" and "dumb" computer AI has been
 * carefully crafted in order to visually and practically notice the change in play style.
 * Moreover, our game now supports network play across Android tablets of the same model.
 * Additionally, our game is also able to run with two, three, and four players locally and
 * remotely. We have added small details to the GUI for style and neatness, and general user
 * friendly environment that includes a text showing the round standings and a text showing the
 * big and small blinds. Not to mention, we were also able to display the "help", "settings", and
 * "exit" buttons.
 *
 * We are currently still having issues with the following bugs.

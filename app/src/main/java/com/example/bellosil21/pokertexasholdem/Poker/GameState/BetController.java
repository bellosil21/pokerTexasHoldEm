     *      A - a player does not have enough chips to fully match a pot
     *          contribution; thus, their call makes them have no more chips
     *      B - a player raises the maximum bet
     *
     * Case A:
     *      This player can only win the bets that match their maximum
     *      contribution. Because they do not have enough to fully call, they
     *      should not be able to win all the bets in this pot. Hence, (1) A
     *      new pot needs to added before the current one in the array that
     *      contains the contribution that match the this player's amount.
     *      (2) This new pot will have the contributors of the pot that comes
     *      after it. Finally, (3) subtract the new pot's contribution from
     *      the next pots contribution.
     *
     * Case B:
     *      When the player raises the maximum bet, we are contributing a new
     *      amount, so we keep track of this new amount with a new pot.
     *      First, contribute all we can until there's nothing more to add to
     *      all the pots. Then, place a new pot at the head of the pot array
     *      with the amount left over.
